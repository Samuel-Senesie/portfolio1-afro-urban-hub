## Design

  ### Design Wireframes
  The wbiste was initially envisioned aith a simple design and structure, which was created using Balsamiq software was used to develop a visual wireframes. These wireframes were designed for desktops, laptops and mobile phones. Please note that there may be some deviations between the final design and the initial wireframes due to adjustment made during the websit's development.

  Below are images of the wireframes that were developed. 

  ![Desktop Wireframe for the Home Page](assets/readme-images/wireframe-home-page-desktop.png)

  ![Desktop Wireframe for About Us Page](assets/readme-images/wireframes-about-us-desktopt.png)

  ![Mobile Wireframe for Contact Page](assets/readme-images/wireframe-mobile.png)

### Site Structure
The AUH website consists of four pages: [Home](index.html), [About Us](about-us.html), [Get Involved](ger-involved.html) and [Contact](contact.html) pages. Users can navigate these pages via the menu bar  diplayed in the top right-hand corner of the second nav bar on tablets, laptops and desktops. 

Each page on the website consists of three nain sections: a double navigation bar at the top, the main content area,  and a double footer at the bottom. 

### Colour Scheme
For the website's colour scheme, a combination of Darksegreen and 'rgba(8, 43, 29, 07)' was chosen, paired with white(#fff) text and fonts for the navbar and footer. The footer headings use black text to creat a distinct contrast with the rest of the footer content.

The darkseagreen colour and white texts were chosen to align with the logo's colours and to symbolize sustainability. 

For the main content, '#f3f2f1' was selected as the background colour for text areas and #333333 was used for the background of divs that hold icons and images.

### Typography
For this website, Oswald font was selected because of its distinctive elongated characzers, which enhances visibility and make text stand out on the page. 

### Imagery Used
The logo featured on this website is a propoerty of Afro Urban Hub. The city photo used on the Home page is credited to the developer of this website. All other images on this site are sourced from third parties and have been properly credited in the citation section of ths document. 

## Present Features

## Future features

The folloing is a non-exhustive list of feautures to be considerd for future development:

### Login

A login option on the menu bar or "Get Involved" page could enable useres to post and contribute to blog posts, access documents and lerning materials from a central repository, showcase thier works and products, access and view events calaender.

### Blog Post

This feature would allow administrators and approved usesr to publish and moderate blog posts according to established community giudeline.

### Document Repository

This centralized document repoitora could be created to share published materials from partners and members, including researsch papers, project reports and other open-source documents and tools The repository could be organized by thematic areas for improved user experience.

### Events Calender

This section would allow users to be informed about upcoming enints, sign up for them, and receive reminders and notifications.

### Signup for Newsletters

This section would allow user to subscribe to newsletters.


### Projects Gallery

The project section to display projects, with links to related doccuments, project details and images.

### Images and Videos Gallery

An image gallery could be added to display photos and videos of projects, products, and events. The gallery could be organized by date, type or events for better user experience.

### Donation

As a non-profit organisation, AUH relys on donations from the public and other institutions. A donation button linked to secure payment gateway, icluding mobile money payment options would be beneficial.

### Expanded Footer

The footer section could be enhanced to display the logos and names of key partners, investors and donors, giving the credits and visibility. 

## Testing


To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py` if your Python file is named `app.py`, of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

By Default, Gitpod gives you superuser security privileges. Therefore, you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you, so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public, you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

### Connecting your Mongo database

- **Connect to Mongo CLI on a IDE**
- navigate to your MongoDB Clusters Sandbox
- click **"Connect"** button
- select **"Connect with the MongoDB shell"**
- select **"I have the mongo shell installed"**
- choose **mongosh (2.0 or later)** for : **"Select your mongo shell version"**
- choose option: **"Run your connection string in your command line"**
- in the terminal, paste the copied code `mongo "mongodb+srv://<CLUSTER-NAME>.mongodb.net/<DBname>" --apiVersion 1 --username <USERNAME>`
  - replace all `<angle-bracket>` keys with your own data
- enter password _(will not echo **\*\*\*\*** on screen)_

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
