Each page on the website consists of three nain sections: a double navigation bar at the top, the main content area,  and a double footer at the bottom. 

### Colour Scheme

## Testing

### Automated Testing 
#### HTML Validation
The HTML and CSS codes for the Afro Urban Hub website were validated using W3C HTML and CSS Validators. Bellow is a summary of the issues identified for all the pages and the actions taken:

**Home Page**

![W3C HTML Validator - Home Page](assets/readme-images/w3c-validator-message-home.png)


![W3C HTML Validator - Home Page1](assets/readme-images/w3s-validator-message_home1.png)

* **ERROR 1:** Bad value for "X-AU-Compatiable" for the `**http-equiv**` attribute on the `<meta>`element (line 7, columns 5-57)
* **SOLUTION:** Corrected a typo from 'AU' to UA in the `**http-equiv**` attribute. 


* **ERROR 2:** Attribute "keyword" not allowed on `<meta>` element (line 12, columns 5-128).
* **ERROE 3:** Missing required attributes (`**charest**`, `**content**`, `**http-equiv**`, `**name**`, `**itemprop**`, `**name**`, `**propoerty**`) on `<meta>`element (line 12 columns 5-128)
* **SOLUTION:** Added miising `**name**` and `**content**`attributes to reolve both errors

* **INFOR:** Trailing slash on void elements interacts badly with unquoted attribute values (line21, columns 5-63).
* **SOULUTION:** Removed trailing slashes from `<link>`elements across all pages.

* **ERROR 4:** Attribute 'el' not allowed on `<a>`element (line 56, columns 21-82).
* **SOLUTIONS:** Corrected the misspelling 'el' to 'rel' in the `<a>`element attribute.

**About Us Page**

* **ERROR:** Same as Error 1 on the Home page.
* **SOLUTION:** Corrected as per Home page solution.


**Get Involved Page**

![W3C HTML Validator - Get Involved Page](assets/readme-images/w3c-validator-message-get-involved.png)

* **ERROR 1:** Duplicated ID 'interest' (line 110, columns 25-42).
* **SOLUTION:** Removed duplicated ID from `<h3>`element. 

* **WARNING:** The first occurrence of ID 'interest' (line 109, columns 21-39).
* **SOLUTION:** Retained the first occurrence and removed the duplicated ID from `<h3>` element.

* **ERROR 2:** The value for the "for" attribute of the `<label>`element must match the ID of the non-hidden form control (line 169, columns 25-55).
* **SOLUTION:** Replaced underscores with hyphens in the input ID to match the `for`attribute.


**Contact US Page:** 
The Contact Us page passed the W3C HTML validation without any errors or warnings, likely due to the corrsctions applied across other pages.

#### CSS Validation

The CSS codes for the Afro Urban Hub website was validated using W3C CSS Validators. Bellow is a summary of the issues identified and the actions taken:

![W3C CSS Validator](assets/readme-images/w3s-css-validation-message.png)

* **ERROR 1:** Line 549, `textarea`Value Error: `border 'ssolid' is not a color; value: '1px ssolid #3a3a3a'`.
* **SOLUTION:** Corrected the typo by changing "ssolid" to "solid"

* **ERROR 2:** lINE 695, `#contact-form-container::before`; Value Error: `background-color '0.3' is not a valid color 3 or 6 hexadecimals numbers`
* **SOLUTION:** Corrected the color value from `rgba(255, 255, 255, 225, 0.3)`to `rgba(255, 255, 255 , 0.3)` and adjusted the alpha value from 255 to 225.

* **ERROR 3:** Line 743, `h3`; Value Error: `font-size unknown dimension '1rempx'`

* **ERROR 5:** Line 808, `#footer-social-icons li::before`; Parse Error: `(-50% -50%)`
* **SOLUTION:** Removed erroneous code as it was redundant.

* **ERROR 6:** Line 1318, `.footeer-container`; Value Error: `width Too many values or values are not recognized: '100%px'`
* **SOLUTION:** Corrected the width value from `100%px`to `100%`.

* **WARNING 1:** Line 2: Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes.
* **SOLUTION:** This warning is as a result of the limitations to the W3C Validator, which cannot check third-party code. No further action was taken. 

* **WARNING 2:** Line 695: `'255' is out of range`.
* **SOLUTION:** Corrected the out-of-range value from 255 to 225.

All errors and warnings from the W3C Validator were addressed. After applying the necessasry corrections, the HTML and CSS codes were revalidated and no further errors were found.

### Lighthouse Testing

After conducting a Lighthouse test via Chrome DevTools to assess Performance, Accessibility, Best Practice and SEO, several issues were identified across al pages. These issues primarilly affected Performance, Accessibility and Browser functionality, impacting overall site performance 

#### Accessibility

![Lighthouse Testing - Home Page](assets/readme-images/lighthouse-home-page.png)

* **Error:** Touch targets, such as icons, didi not have sufficient size and spacing.
* **Solution:** Resolved by removing the TikTok icon and Whatsapp number, and increasing the font size and spacing in the top bar to create space for the touchable elements.

* **Error:** Some links did not have discernible names for screen readers.
* **Solution:** Added `aria-label`attributes to the back-to-top and Whatsapp icons to provide clear labels.

#### Browser Error
* **Error:** Uncaught SyntaxError: "missing `)`, after argument list" at index.html240:13
* **Solution:** Corrected by replacing the colon with a comma at line 240,  column 13. This fix was applied to all relevant pages.

* **Error:** Insufficient contrast ratio between background and foreground colors.
* **Solution:** Improved contrast by changng the background color from `#fff`to `rgb(225, 225, 225)`

* **Error:** Failed to load resources with a 404 status; syntax error in `site.webmanifest`.
* **Action:** This issue remains unresloved due to its complexity.

#### Performance
* **Problem:** Images were not properly sized, affecting performance.
* **Solution:** The problem was addressed by removing, resizing and compressing icons, logo, and images using TinyPNG and ILoveIMG. While performance improved, the issue was not completely reloved.
